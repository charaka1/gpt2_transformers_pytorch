The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells sea shells by the sea shore.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow.
I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Actions speak louder than words.
The early bird catches the worm.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
Don't cry over spilled milk.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Barking dogs seldom bite.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Better late than never.
Every dog has its day.
Familiarity breeds contempt.
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
Honesty is the best policy.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Life is like a box of chocolates.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
No pain, no gain.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Practice makes perfect.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Actions speak louder than words.
A watched pot never boils.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
The early bird catches the worm.
Haste makes waste.
A penny for your thoughts.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Honesty is the best policy.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
